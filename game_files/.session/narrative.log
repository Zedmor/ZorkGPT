[Turn 785] (Entrance Hades, Score: 301)
> south
Oh, no! A lurking grue slithered into the room and devoured you!            You have died         As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed. The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even unreal.  Entrance to Hades You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed    Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!  The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard. There is a brass bell here.
