## DANGERS & THREATS

**Grue Attacks**: Any dark location without a light source → eaten by grue.
- Recognition: "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue."
- Prevention: Always carry brass lantern or ivory torch. Light immediately on entering dark areas.
- Note: Torch is permanent (never runs out). Lantern has limited fuel.

**Troll (Troll Room, ID: 102)**: Blocks all passages until killed.
- Weapon: Sword (one-hit kill with sword). Knife works but is less effective.
- Priority: When sword glows, enemies are nearby — switch to combat mode immediately.

**Trap Door Self-Locks**: Going down through trap door in Living Room causes it to bar itself.
- Must reopen from above each time. Plan surface returns accordingly.

**Candle Vaporization**: Do NOT bring the ivory torch near the candles at Altar/Hades entrance.
- The torch vaporizes the candles.
- Use matches to light candles instead.

## STRATEGIC PATTERNS

**Inventory Management**: Carry only what you need. Drop excess in safe locations (Living Room near trophy case is ideal). Retrieve items for specific puzzles.

**Light Source Priority**: Ivory torch (Torch Room, ID: 105) is permanent — never runs out. Get it as soon as rope is available from Attic. Lantern has limited fuel — conserve it until torch is obtained.

**Treasure Caching**: Deposit treasures in trophy case (Living Room, ID: 193) as soon as possible. Each deposit scores points. Don't carry treasures through dangerous areas.

**Explore Before Committing**: Examine objects and rooms thoroughly before taking actions. Read descriptions for puzzle hints — emphasized adjectives and sensory details are clues.

**Save Before Risk**: Always save checkpoint before: combat encounters, irreversible actions (one-way passages), unknown areas, using consumable items.

**Surface Return Route**: Altar (ID: 212) → pray → Forest (ID: 78). Fastest underground-to-surface shortcut.

## COMMAND SYNTAX

**Parser Basics**: VERB-NOUN format, 1-3 words. Parser reads only first 6 letters of each word.

**Window Entry**: Use "open window" then "enter window" (not "go through window" or "climb window").

**Echo Room**: Type exactly "echo" as the command (not "say echo").

**Dam Bolt**: "turn bolt with wrench" (need wrench in inventory).

**Bell/Book/Candles**: "ring bell", then "light match", "light candles with match", "take candles", "read book" — exact sequence matters.

**Sceptre**: "wave sceptre" at End of Rainbow.

**Combat**: "attack [enemy] with sword" — always specify weapon.
